Midori
------

Midori is a script library extension for the storyboard editor software [storybrew](https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew). Its main intentions are to promote rapid development of elaborate visual effects within storybrew by offering generalized calculation methods, data types, and other features.

Features
--------
The library includes...

 - **Motion**. Generate a point of coordinates given a function using a path type. Includes a set of parametric equations.
 - **Color**. Color adjustment methods inspired by [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Color interpolation. Create a ``Color4`` type from an HSB, HSV, or hex code. Coming soon: gradients, palettes.
 - **Unit Testing**. Basic unit testing is possible by adding ``void`` parameter-less methods with ``Assert`` cases. Output seen in a log, with error tracing for failed test cases.
